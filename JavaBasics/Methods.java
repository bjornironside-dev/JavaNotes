Basically methods are functions but when they are inside class they are referred as methods.

A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform
a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code.
We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again.
It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code.
The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.

Why Methods (Key Characteristics)?
->Reusability: Methods provides code reusability.
Once a method is defined, it can be called multiple times from various parts of the program.
->Modularity: Methods help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
->Maintainability: With methods, updating and debugging code becomes easier since changes
in one part of the program do not necessarily impact other parts.
->Abstraction: Methods provide a way to encapsulate implementation details,
exposing only the necessary parts to the users.


// Method Declaration Example

// Access Specifier: Controls the visibility of the method
// Return Type: The data type of the value returned by the method
// Method Name: The name used to call the method
// Parameter List: Inputs passed to the method

    public int sum(int a, int b) {
    // ‚Üê Method Header (includes access specifier, return type, method name, and parameters)

    // Method Body: The block of code that runs when the method is called
    return a + b;

    // Method Signature: Includes method name and parameter list (sum(int a, int b))
