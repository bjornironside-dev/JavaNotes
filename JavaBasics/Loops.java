        * üîÅ What are Loops in Java?
          Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly under certain conditions. Java supports several types of loops:

        1. for loop
        2. while loop
        3. do-while loop
        4. Enhanced for loop (also called for-each loop)
        *
        * | Loop Type  | Best For                                       |
          | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
          | `for`      | Known number of iterations                     |
          | `while`    | Unknown number of iterations (condition first) |
          | `do-while` | Run at least once, condition checked later     |
          | `for-each` | Collections and arrays                         |


        ‚úÖ When to Use Loops
        Repeating a task a specific number of times

        Iterating over arrays or collections

        Waiting for a condition to change

        Automating repetitive logic

        // 1. for loop
/*        for (initialization; condition; update) {
            // code to be executed

        // 2. while loop
        /*
        * while (condition) {
        code to be executed
        }
        * */

        // 3. do-while loop
        /*
        * do{
        * code to be executed
        * }while(condition);
        * */

        // 4. for-each loop
        /*
        * for (type var : array) {
        * // code to be executed
        * }
        * */
